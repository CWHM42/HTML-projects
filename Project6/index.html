        <h3>Our cafe serves simply the best food you will taste.  We guarantee it!</h3>
        <p>The Brunch Cafe was established in 2001 with one goal in mind: to serve our customers the finest breakfast food in the world.  It is our profound belief that food should be delicous and good for you.</p>
        <p>You want eggs? <b>We got it.</b>  You want coffee? <b>We got it.</b>  We promise that we'll never cut corners or comprimise on quality.  We are also extremely proud of our wide selection of pastries.  Our chef wakes up every morning at 2AM to make our baked goods from scratch.  <em>He literally sleeps only 3 or 4 hours a night!</em>  With every bite into our croissants and muffins, you'll taste a difference that sets up apart from our competitors.  Trust us, you'll never go anywhere else!</p>
        <p>If you're not completely satisfied with our food, you don't have to pay!  (Just don't give us a negative review on Yelp.  We'll sue.)</p>
